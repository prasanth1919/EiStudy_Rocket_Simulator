- folder contains various design patterns

## Exercise 2
- The **Rocket Launch Simulator** is a terminal-based simulation that allows users to experience launching a rocket into orbit with real-time updates on fuel, altitude, speed, and stage separations. It features fast-forwarding capabilities to skip through the simulation and uses the Observer pattern to notify display and logging systems of key events. Users can customize the rocket's parameters, such as fuel level, orbit distance, and type (light or heavy). The goal is to successfully reach orbit while managing fuel consumption and stage transitions.
